I want a Chrome extension that makes it easy to move the current tab to a different window.

With one keystroke, the extension should display a list of the current windows overlaid over the current window, and centered in the window. Each of the tabs has a number next to it, and typing the number moves the current tab to the window with the corresponding number.
