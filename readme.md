## How It Works

### Window Identification
TabMover uses **intelligent fingerprinting** to identify windows based on their content:
- **Domain patterns** - Unique combinations of websites in each window
- **Tab composition** - Number of tabs and primary active domain
- **Similarity matching** - 50%+ similarity threshold for reliable identification
- **Persistent storage** - Names sync across devices via Chrome storage

### Last Window Memory
The extension remembers which window you last moved a tab to. This enables the quick "move to last window" feature that's perfect for organizing tabs between specific windows.

### Dynamic Updates
- **Real-time fingerprinting** - Window fingerprints update as you move tabs
- **Automatic recalculation** - Both manual and extension-based tab moves trigger updates
- **Smart key management** - Handles significant fingerprint changes gracefully
